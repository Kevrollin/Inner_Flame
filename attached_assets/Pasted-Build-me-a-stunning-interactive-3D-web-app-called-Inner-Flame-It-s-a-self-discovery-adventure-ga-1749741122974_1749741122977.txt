Build me a stunning, interactive 3D web app called "Inner Flame". It’s a self-discovery adventure game themed around the user traveling inside their own mind. The overall style should be glowing, smooth, slightly surreal, and calming — think Journey meets Celeste, but in modern 3D web style. The mood should feel empowering, emotional, and artistic.

Pages & Flow:
Welcome Page
A fullscreen carousel slider introducing the app’s concept: emotional growth, self-discovery, overcoming inner obstacles (fear, doubt, etc).
Each slide should have a glowing image background, motivational text overlay, and smooth transitions (slide or fade).
Call-to-action buttons: “Start Your Journey”, “Sign In”, and “Learn More”.
Background music toggle, subtle particle animation, or ambient effects to keep it engaging.

Authentication Pages
Use Supabase for sign up, login, and forgot password.
Auth UI should be themed with the same glowing, minimal aesthetic.
Add a quote or mantra per auth page — like “Every flame starts small.” or “Doubt is just a shadow.”
Game Dashboard / Core Experience
Once logged in, the user lands on a dashboard/map area showing their current level (“Mental Realm”) — like Fear, Doubt, Anxiety, etc.
Each realm unlocks one by one as progress is made.
Include a progress bar or glowing “Clarity Meter”.
Add interactive cards or portals that animate on hover/click to enter a level.
Space for in-game journal entries, reflections, or saved milestones.

Design Style
Visuals should be neon-glow inspired, with dark backgrounds and animated glowing accents.
Fonts: modern, soft, elegant — readable but unique.
Use interactive hover effects, light particle effects, glowing buttons, and smooth transitions.
Design must not feel like a corporate dashboard — think vibey, magical, and emotional.

Functional Requirements
Fully responsive for desktop and mobile.
Supabase integration for user accounts and saved game progress.
Easy to expand: allow additional “mental realms” or levels to be added.
Smooth routing between pages.

Vibe Notes
The app should feel like a personal journey, not a typical game UI.
Add subtle ambient sounds, glowing transitions, and emotional animations.
Use colors that feel safe, warm, and dreamy — soft purples, blues, pink glows.
